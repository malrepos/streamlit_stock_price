# Streamlit Stock Price

Built using the freedodecamp course "Build 12 Data Science Apps with Python and Streamlit"

## Purpose

The app displays stock charts in a web app using the streamlit library.

## Libraries

For this project I used:

- yfinance
- streamlit
- pandas

## Results

The displayed charts for Apple Ince, closing and volume, are displayed very clearly. The layout for streamlit is clean and modern. The code needed to build this app is very concise, roughly 15 lines. Using markdown for design may be a little restrictive for anything complicated.
